# Redux Boilerplate

Simple React + Redux + Redux toolkit boilerplate for all your global state needs. Comments in Finnish. It's a brilliant language, you should learn it!

# How to run?
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/anttituomola/redux-boilerplate.git your-folder-name`
2. Go to folder: `cd your-folder-name`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the app: `npm start`

# Issues?
If you get an error: "Plugin "react" was conflicted between "package.json Â» eslint-config-react-app" just **open the package.json and re-save it**. That should solve the issue.

In case you have to repeat this every time the site rerenders, do this instead:
**In your terminal cd (means go) yourself to the folder where the project is and re-run npm start**. Use the correct casing, so be sure to write Desktop insted of desktop, if that is the correct version of the folder.

This problem is Windows-specific.
